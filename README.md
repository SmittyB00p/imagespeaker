# ImageSpeaker

Welcome to ImageSpeaker!!

This application uses Google's Gemini-2.5 model to extract text from an uploaded image and then, using a recent text-to-speech (TTS) model - Sesame, human-like audio will be generated from the extracted text.

## Thanks

This application would not be possible without all the people behind Sesame AI's CSM (https://github.com/SesameAILabs/csm).

Also [knottwill](https://github.com/knottwill/sesame-finetune) for the finetuning capability.

As well as the people behind (https://github.com/nari-labs/dia).

Thank you all!!

Hopefully I have used your creations in a good way.
